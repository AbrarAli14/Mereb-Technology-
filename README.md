# Mereb Technology Test - Ping App

A full-stack application built by **Abrar Ali** for Mereb Technology, featuring a React frontend and PHP REST backend, deployed with Docker.

## Overview
This app allows users to send a custom string via a "Ping" button, which is processed by a PHP backend and displayed on the frontend. It includes a resume section showcasing my experience as a Full-Stack Web Developer at Sebez System Technology.

## Features
- **Ping Test**: Input a string, click "Ping To Me ðŸ˜œ", and see the response (e.g., "hello" â†’ "Response: hello").
- **Resume Section**: Highlights my skills (Laravel, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Docker) and links to GitHub, Portfolio, and LinkedIn.
- **Design**: Modern UI with Outfit font, Tailwind CSS, and animations (fade-in, hover effects, slide-in).
- **Testing**: Backend tested with PHPUnit.
- **Dockerized**: Portable setup with `docker-compose`.
